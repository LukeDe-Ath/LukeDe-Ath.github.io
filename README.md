# My Portfolio
This project should be a static website that shares projects from my Codecademy course.

It will include:
1. A main page that features different projects I've built
2. A contact page with my details
3. Specific pages that go further into detail for each project

----

What I plan to include:
- Brief 'About me' section
- Clear way of showing my skills
- A photo (if i can find a decent one)
